    <div class="card-body">
        <p>The <span>toArray</span> operator in RxJS is used to collect all the values emitted by the source observable and emit them
            as a single array when the source completes. This is useful when you need to gather all emitted values and
            process them together after the observable sequence has completed.</p>
